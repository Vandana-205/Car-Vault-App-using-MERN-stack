*Car Vault App*
*Overview*
The Car Vault App is a full-stack web application designed to manage and track vehicles securely. This application consists of a React.js frontend and a Node.js/Express.js backend, with MongoDB as the database for data storage. The app allows users to authenticate, manage vehicle data, and track vehicles in real-time.
*Features*
*Backend*
User Authentication: JWT-based authentication system to secure API endpoints.
Vehicle Management: CRUD operations for vehicle data.
Real-time Tracking: API endpoints to track vehicles in real-time.
Secure API: Implemented with security best practices to protect user data.
Database Integration: MongoDB for storing vehicle and user data.
*Frontend*
User Interface: Built with React.js to provide a dynamic and responsive user experience.
API Integration: Uses Axios to communicate with the backend API.
Date Management: Moment.js for handling and displaying dates.
State Management: Manages application state efficiently with React’s component-based architecture.
**Installation and Setup
